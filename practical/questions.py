#Remember to add a # to the question after you answer the question
1. Write a print statement with your name and your github account


2. Create two strings to represent your name and your github account



3. Define a function that prints the name and github account you defined in 2 above. Taking the two as arguments. Remember to use
    string formating for the print statement




4.  Define another function that takes two integers as argumnents. Using the function, calculate the summation,product, division
    subtraction,modulus and exponentiation of the numbers. Append each of the calculation to a list and use a return statement to 
    return the list




5. Define another function that takes a list as an argument. Pass to it  the returned list in 4 above, use a for loop to traverse 
the list, and print the individual calculations you returned in (4) above




6. Lastly, define a function that accepts age from a user. use an if statement to check whether the age is above 18.
  -- If the age is above 18, ask the user for their name and their github account name and print them using string formatting
  --if the age is above 25,call the function in (3)
  -- if the age is above 35 call the function in (4), 
  --if the age is above 55 call the function in(5)
  -- else create a variable and assign it the string "this is the end of todays practical" and then print the upper case version of
  the string
